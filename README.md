# FISH Dataset
## What is FISH?
Fishermen Investigating Seasonal Hypoxia (FISH) is a cooperative fisheries research effort in the Pacific Northwest where through a partnership with commercial, charter, and tribal fishermen spatially distrbuted oxygen measuremnts are collected. The purpose of this partnership is to better understand the spatial manifestation of seasonal hypoxia throughout the Pacific Northwest. Hypoxia, or low oxygen episodes are linked to upwelling and have been documented to recur annually since the early 2000’s. Crab fishermen were among the first to notice the impacts of hypoxia when pulling up pots full of dead crabs. This partnership provides fishermen with a tool to respond adaptively to changing ocean chemistry. Check out our [website](https://fishresearch.net) to see the data on our dashboard.  
## What is in this repository?
In short, data. This repo is home to data collected across the entire FISH project. This includes partnership with fishing industry as well as state agencies. In the ```Collections``` directory you will find sub-directories for each distinct project with more information on each data stream.

## How are the data calibrated?
To ensure accuracy and promote confidence in the sensor technology, regular calibrations were carried out. These calibrations took place pre-deployment and post-recovery; typical deployment times ranged between 2-5 months depending on fishing effort. We calibrated each instrument by exposing the sensor to saturated DO concentrations and then 0 DO concentrations. This process is replicated for all 38 instruments over the last three years and continuing on into the future. This provides an average offset of ```0.035 ∓ 0.036 mg L-1```. In-situ comparison of measurements from these instruments with neighboring oceanographic assets (OOI, PISCO) have validated the accuracy for measuring ocean chemistry.
