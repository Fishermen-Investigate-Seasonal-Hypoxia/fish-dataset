# FISH Dataset
## What is FISH?
Fishermen Investigating Seasonal Hypoxia (FISH) is a cooperative fisheries research effort in the Pacific Northwest where through a partnership with commercial, charter, and tribal fishermen spatially distrbuted oxygen measuremnts are collected. The purpose of this partnership is to better understand the spatial manifestation of seasonal hypoxia throughout the Pacific Northwest. Hypoxia, or low oxygen episodes are linked to upwelling and have been documented to recur annually since the early 2000â€™s. Crab fishermen were among the first to notice the impacts of hypoxia when pulling up pots full of dead crabs. This partnership provides fishermen with a tool to respond adaptively to changing ocean chemistry. Check out our [website](https://fishresearch.net) to see the data on our dashboard.  
## What is in this repository?
In short, data. This repo is home to data collected across the entire FISH project. This includes partnership with fishing industry as well as state agencies. In the ```Collections``` directory you will find sub-directories for each distinct project with more information on each data stream.
